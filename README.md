# Playground Repository

🚀 This repository contains multiple projects across various platforms, including Android, .NET Core, iOS, Flutter, and more. The purpose of this repository is to build the same basic idea on several platforms and play around with various approaches and technologies in order to learn new things, trying different technologies.

## Current Projects

👨‍💻 Here are the projects that are currently under development in this repository:

- 📱 [Android App](https://github.com/agahfurkan/android-kotlin-playground): A Native Android project written with Kotlin.
- 🌐 [.NET Core API](https://github.com/agahfurkan/backend-playground): A RESTful API for mobile playground projects.

## Mockups

🎨 For the mobile platform projects, I have created a set of mockups using Figma to help visualize the design and layout of the applications. You can find the Figma file [here](https://www.figma.com/file/3W2cU5S3TRtYfgSkAZsEf2/Playground-Application?node-id=0%3A1&t=LNfb5zfgqdGQcth3-1).

## Development Status

👨‍💻 This repository is under heavy active development, and as such, some of the code may be messy or incomplete. While I strive to follow best practices and write clean, maintainable code, some parts of the projects may not be up to the same standard as others. However, I welcome feedback from others.
